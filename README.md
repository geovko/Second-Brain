## Description

In a fast-paced lifestyle where one is flooded with many different situations and tasks to complete, keeping track of all your thoughts and tasks can be a challenge. This project aims to provide the user with a note-taking webpage or a second brain, if you will, to help them keep track of everything that pops up.

## Usage

To open the webpage, click this link here to go directly!

Once the text areas are filled, the 'Clear' and 'Save' options will appear. 'Clear' will empty the text areas, while 'Save' will save the inputted texts and generate it on the left side of the screen. The user can then click on the small red trash can icon on the left (adjacent to the note they wish to delete) to remove that specific note.
